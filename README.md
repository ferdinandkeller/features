# Features

This project **Features** is a set of reusable 'features'. Quickly add a tool/cli to a development container.

*Features* are self-contained units of installation code and development container configuration. Features are designed to install atop a wide-range of base container images (this repo focuses on **debian based images**).

> This repo follows the [dev container feature distribution specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).

**List of features:**

* [httpie](src/httpie/README.md): Installs HTTPie, a command line HTTP client.
